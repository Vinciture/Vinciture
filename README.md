- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vinciture. I'm a doctor specialising in Emergency Medicine, Intensive Care and Event Medicine in Australia.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how IT can make healthcare better, and how I can use simple scripting and code to automate basic stuff in my workplaces on platforms like html/php websites and the microsoft ecosystem.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to figure out how the heck to do that
- ğŸ“« reach me through GitHub
